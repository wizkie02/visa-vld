# 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Travel Buddy AI Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The Travel Buddy AI has been successfully integrated into your visa validator system. Here's what you need to do to start using it:

---

## 🎯 To Start Using Travel Buddy AI:

### Step 1: Get Your API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://rapidapi.com/TravelBuddyAI/api/visa-requirement**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** or **"Log In"**
3. Click **"Subscribe to Test"** (Free tier: 100 requests/month)
4. Go to **"Endpoints"** tab
5. Copy your **X-RapidAPI-Key** (looks like: `abc123def456...`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your Project

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root (create one if it doesn't exist)
2. Add this line:
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=paste-your-actual-key-here
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Test the Integration

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
node test-travel-buddy.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Vietnam → USA
✅ Vietnam → Liberia (previously empty)
✅ Vietnam → Namibia (previously empty)

Test Results: 6 passed, 0 failed
✅ Travel Buddy AI integration is working!
```

### Step 4: Start Your Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**That's it! Your visa validator now uses government-sourced data! 🎉**

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Server Logs:
When you make a visa check request, look for this in your logs:
```
[RAG-RETRIEVE] Using Travel Buddy AI: vietnam → usa
[TRAVEL-BUDDY] ✅ Got visa status: visa_required
```

If you see **"Using Travel Buddy AI"**, it's working! ✅

---

## ❓ What If I Don't Have an API Key?

No problem! The system still works without Travel Buddy:

1. It will automatically fall back to **Passport Index API**
2. You'll see this in logs: `[RAG-RETRIEVE] Using Passport Index`
3. Everything still works, but with less accurate data

**To disable the Travel Buddy check entirely:**
Add this to `.env`:
```
USE_TRAVEL_BUDDY=false
```
