COMPREHENSIVE TRANSLATION SYSTEM VERIFICATION

Current Status:
✓ Language selector positioned in top-left corner with Globe icon
✓ Translation keys added for legal disclaimer content
✓ Chinese translations added for all disclaimer sections  
✓ Vietnamese translations added for all disclaimer sections
✓ Home page updated to use translation keys instead of hardcoded text

Testing Results:
- English: All sections working
- Chinese: Title and button translate, disclaimer should now translate
- Vietnamese: Title and button translate, disclaimer should now translate
- Language persistence: Working via localStorage
- Event system: Custom events broadcasting language changes

Next Steps:
1. Verify disclaimer translations are working properly
2. Test Spanish, French, and Hindi translations
3. Add missing translation keys for any remaining hardcoded content
4. Test complete workflow with language switching across all pages

Issue Identified:
User reported disclaimer content remaining in English when switching to Chinese.
This should now be resolved with the addition of translation keys.
